# Cellranger Singularity Container

### A containerized version of the 10x Gemomics Cellranger pipeline

This repository holds the source code for continuous integration and deployment of a Singularity container for the 10x Gemomics Cellranger single cell analysis pipeline. 

The raw pipeline is available from [10x Geomomics](https://support.10xgenomics.com/single-cell-gene-expression/software/pipelines/latest/what-is-cell-ranger)

The latest generated container is available from [Singularity Hub](https://singularity-hub.org/collections/253/)

### Singularity is a unique container technology:

Singularity allows simple porting and reproducing:

It encompasses **the whole spectrum od resources for a computational analysis**:
 - operating system
 - sofware libraries, tools, and pipelines
 - data, analysis, reports, figures
 
It allows simple **reproducibility on a wide variety of computing resources**: 
- HPC (University High Performance Computing Clusters)
- Cloud (AWS, Google Cloud, Azure, Openstack)
- Mac OS (your laptop!)
- Windows (your laptop!)

### Singularity is powerful and simple to use 

See the [tutorial notebook](https://github.com/YeoLab/cellranger/blob/master/TUTORIAL.ipynb) to install Singularity on MacOS or Windows and instructions to run the cellranger container.

Singularity can import containers from other containers formats such as Docker.
