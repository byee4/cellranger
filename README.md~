# Cellranger

### A containerized version of the 10x Gemomics Cellranger pipeline

This repository holds the source code for continuous integration and deployment of the 10x Gemomics Cellranger single cell analysis pipeline. 

The raw pipeline is available from [10x Geomomics](https://support.10xgenomics.com/single-cell-gene-expression/software/pipelines/latest/what-is-cell-ranger)

The latest generated container is available from [Singularity Hub](https://singularity-hub.org/collections/253/)

### Singularity is a unique container technology:

Singularity allows simple porting and reproducing:

It encompasses the whole spectrum od resources for a computational analysis:
 - operating system
 - sofware libraries tools and pipelines
 - data, analysis reports, figures...) 
 
It allows simple reproducibility in a wide variety of computing resources: 
- HPC (Universities High Performance Computing clusters)
- Cloud (AWS, Google Cloud, Azure, Openstack, ...)
- Mac OS (your laptop!)
- Windows (your laptop!)

### Singularity is powerful and simple to use 

See the [tutorial notebook](https://github.com/YeoLab/cellranger/blob/master/TUTORIAL.ipynb) to install Singularity on MacOS or Windows and instructions to run the cellranger container

Singularity can import containers from other containers formats such as Docker.
